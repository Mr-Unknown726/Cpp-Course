Facts: An even number is always divisible by 2 while a odd number is not 



So we can check if a number n is odd or even by dividing it with 2 and see is it is completely divisible or not

How can we check if it is completely divisible or not .. by checking if the remainder is 0 or not .

How do we get the remainder : by doing n%2 because n%2 gives us the remainder when n is divided by 2 
So if (n%2)={ 0  -> n is even
              non 0 -> n is odd
               }
